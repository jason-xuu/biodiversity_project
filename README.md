Endangered Species Data Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing data from the National Parks Service to understand the conservation statuses of endangered species across various national parks. By investigating patterns and themes in the types of species that become endangered, we aim to derive meaningful insights and share them with the public.

Project Overview
In this project, we will:

Interpret data from the National Parks Service related to endangered species.
Perform data analysis and cleaning to prepare the dataset for further exploration.
Investigate potential patterns in the conservation statuses of different species.
Pose specific questions about the data and seek to answer them with meaningful insights.
Visualize findings through plots and charts.
Share conclusions and key takeaways from the analysis.
Steps Involved
Data Acquisition
Obtain data on endangered species from the National Parks Service. This data will include species names, conservation statuses, and the parks they inhabit.

Data Cleaning
Perform data cleaning to handle missing or inconsistent values, ensure data types are correct, and prepare the data for analysis.

Data Analysis
Analyze the conservation statuses of species across different parks. Investigate the following questions:

Are certain types of species (e.g., mammals, birds, reptiles) more likely to become endangered?
Do particular parks have higher numbers of endangered species?
Are there any observable patterns in the conservation statuses of species over time?
Data Visualization
Use plots and charts to visualize key findings from the analysis, such as species distributions, conservation statuses by species type, and geographic patterns of endangered species.

Conclusion
Summarize key insights and takeaways from the analysis. These findings will be shared with the National Parks Service to help in understanding and protecting endangered species.
